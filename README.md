the script is not mine. i simply used this because i like adding this to my games.

HOW TO MAKE IT WORK:
1: first, you will create a script inside of roblox studio.
2: after creating the script, you will copy and paste the script on the other file of this repository, into the script you just created.
3: drag the script inside of whatever brick you want to be color changing, in the studio explorer for your game.


It is optional to edit the script, its set up for you, so there's no point of having to, but if you're a script-savvy type person, do what you please.
